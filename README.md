# Unity_Tank_Game
This is a practice project designed to learn and practice basic to advanced C# concepts.

# Style and Comment:
The original purpose of this project is to practice basic programming concepts and try out some advanced techniques like design patterns. So the style of code and commenting style does not follow the official guideline entirely. Since I developed such project when I was still a junior in high school. I'm unaware of the potential of collaboration on a bigger platform. Thus I spent no time refactoring and commenting my code. Consequently, any future contributor can help me set a tone in the programming style and proper comments.
