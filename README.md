# Unity_Tank_Game
This is a practice project designed to learn and practice basic to advanced C# concepts.

# Style and Comment:
The original purpose of this project is to practice basic programming concepts and try out some advanced techniques like design patterns. So the style of code and commenting style does not follow the official guideline entirely. Since I developed such project when I was still a junior in high school. I'm unaware of the potential of collaboration on a bigger platform. Thus I spent no time refactoring and commenting my code. Consequently, any future contributor can help me set a tone in the programming style and proper comments.

# Content:
The game is basic a bullet-dodging game with the user be able to swap positions, teleport, accelerate and survive as long as possible. Some of the textures are hand-drawn and some comes from pixel-art creaters. Any future development of game mechanisms, art, and other features can be added through talking with me.

# Future Development:
Since I've left behind C# and moves on to Java and Python, I will spend most of my time learning at school. However, because of the passion for game development, I would come back and work on this project any time soon. For any suggestions and potential collaborations, we can talk through gitHub. Forgive me that I could possibly not leave any personal contact on this page.

# Language and Platform Choice:
I choice C# Unity for my main language of development for two reasons: C# is an extremly easy language for beginners to work on. There are many distinct and useful tutorials availbale on Youtube, Unity, Github, and many other online communities. So, when I was a noob at programming, I was more than happy to take the minimal effort in terms of looking for resources. And Unity is very easy to use compared to many other game engines, such as Unreal. However, I'm not saying the Unity is perfect; through a year of intermittent development, I realized that Unity is not an all good solution for easy game design. But it is free!
